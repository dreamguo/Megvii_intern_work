## Background
It is difficult for humans to continuously monitor traffic violations. Therefore, fully automatic monitoring of traffic violations is becoming more and more important. However, insufficient vehicle recognition accuracy and excessive reliance on calibrated cameras are two majar challenges. We overcome these problems and achieve great performances on many practical applications.

## Task
Precisely detect the bounding box of each car and 78 keypoints(only show visible ones) of it.
During the process, we also estimate camera internal and external parameters.

## Demo
One practical application on a traffic camera.
Demo contains the prediction of ground surface, bbox, and keypoints.
